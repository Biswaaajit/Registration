# Student Registration System

Welcome to our Student Registration System! This platform allows you to efficiently manage student records by adding their personal details, including their name, email, and contact number. The details are displayed in a dynamic, user-friendly table where you can view all entries at a glance.




## Features

- Add New Student Information: Easily add a new student's name, email, and contact number. The system automatically generates and stores the details in the data table below.
- Edit Details: You can edit a student’s information directly from the table. However, to maintain data integrity, the student ID remains locked and uneditable.
- Delete Records: If a student’s information is no longer needed, you can quickly remove it from the table.
